#### Author - Kushal Agrawal

The compilation and execution of this program requires that the user have Python 3 installed on their system. Additional modules required for proper functioning are:
	a) [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
	b) [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
After installing Python 3 and the aforementioned modules, one only needs to run the python script "compare.py" by typing "python3 compare.py" in whatever terminal/console one prefers.
